```{r, echo=FALSE}
## Repository structure
library(fs)

# Get all tracked files via git
tracked_files <- system("git ls-files", intern = TRUE)

# Extract top-level folders
top_level_dirs <- unique(dirname(tracked_files))
top_level_dirs <- top_level_dirs[top_level_dirs != "."]

# Filter only top-level folders in the current directory
tracked_dirs <- dir_ls(path = ".", type = "directory", recurse = 0)
tracked_dirs <- tracked_dirs[basename(tracked_dirs) %in% basename(top_level_dirs)]

# Visualize only tracked folders
purrr::walk(tracked_dirs, ~ dir_tree(.x, recurse = 0))


```

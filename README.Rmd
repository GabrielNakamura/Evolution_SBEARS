# Context

This repository contains all the data and codes (R scripts) to replicate the 
    analyses in the manuscript **SBEARS - A site-based method to estimate ancestral ranges of species** in review.

# Repository structure

The repository is structured as followed

```{r, echo=FALSE}
## Repository structure
library(fs)

# Get all tracked files via git
tracked_files <- system("git ls-files", intern = TRUE)

# Extract top-level folders
top_level_dirs <- unique(dirname(tracked_files))
top_level_dirs <- top_level_dirs[top_level_dirs != "."]

# Filter only top-level folders in the current directory
tracked_dirs <- dir_ls(path = ".", type = "directory", recurse = 0)
tracked_dirs <- tracked_dirs[basename(tracked_dirs) %in% basename(top_level_dirs)]

# Visualize only tracked folders
purrr::walk(tracked_dirs, ~ dir_tree(.x, recurse = 0))


```

## Main folders

-   `R_functions`: folder containing auxiliary functions that are called
    in scripts and Rmarkdown files to run analyses

-   `R_scripts`: folder with all the Rmarkdown files needed to run the
    simulations used in the paper

-   `gen3sis_simulations`: folders with files needed to set the
    simulations parameters

    -   `config`: `config_presence_high_diversity` folder contains the
        file `config_presence.R` that presents the parameters to
        simulate the high species richness scenario.
        `config_presence_less_coex` contains the file
        `config_presence_less_coex.R` that contains the parameters
        configuration to simulate the scenario of low species richness.

-   `landscape_plain`: contains the files needed to set the simulation
    in a landscape with homogeneous environment and 100 grids

-   `landscape_plain_900`: contains the files needed to set the
    simulation in a landscape with 900 grids

-   `gen3sis_simulations_grid100_high_species`: contains all the 100 replicates of
    the simulations for the scenario of high species richness in a 100 grid 
    landscape
    
      - `gen3sis_output_dispersion_res_100_highdiv`: contains the output (.rds) for 
          all the 100 replicates of the high species richness in a 100 grid landscape
          processed to extract the site composition (nodes and species x 
          grids) and phylogenetic tree

- `gen3sis_simulations_high_diversity_grid900`: contains all the 100 replicates of
    the simulations for the scenario of high species richness in a 900 grid 
    landscape
    
     -  `gen3sis_output_high_diversity_grid900`: processed output (.rds files)
         with the site composition and phylogenetic tree 
         
- `gen3sis_simulations_low_diversity_grid100`: contains all the 100 replicates of
    the simulations for the scenario of low species richness in a 100 grid 
    landscape
    
     - `gen3sis_output_lowdiv_100`: processed output (.rds files)
         with the site composition and phylogenetic tree
         
- `gen3sis_simulations_low_diversity_grid900`: contains all the 100 replicates of
    the simulations for the scenario of low species richness in a 900 grid 
    landscape
    
     - `gen3sis_output_low_diversity_grid900`: processed output (.rds files)
         with the site composition and phylogenetic tree
         
- `empirical data`: contains all the data and code needed to run the empirical 
    analyses of ancestral area reconstruction and comparison of methods (SBEARS,
    rase and BioGeoBEARS) for different spatial grains. `Script.R` contains all the
    code needed to run the analyses.
    
- `simulated datas`: contains all data and code needed to run the analyses of 
    ancestral area reconstruction and comparison of methods (SBEARS, rase and 
    BioGeoBEARS) with simulated data.
